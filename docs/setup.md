# Installation and safety

## Windows preflight

In PowerShell from the repository root:

```powershell
.\install.ps1 -DryRun
.\install.ps1
```

If the requested Ubuntu distribution is missing, use an elevated PowerShell
and explicitly opt in:

```powershell
.\install.ps1 -InstallWSL
```

Reboot if requested and complete the Ubuntu user setup. The default distro
is `Ubuntu-24.04`; pass `-Distro <name>` to select another installed or
installable distribution. Dry-run never invokes WSL or installs packages.

To install Ubuntu prerequisites and then attempt the opt-in OpenCode setup
from Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
.\\install.ps1 -DryRun -RunUbuntuBootstrap -InstallOpenCode
.\\install.ps1 -RunUbuntuBootstrap -InstallOpenCode
```

**Node.js:** `-InstallOpenCode` now runs the opt-in Node.js prerequisite installer first. It checks for Node.js 20+ and npm, and attempts installation from Ubuntu `apt` when missing. Some Ubuntu releases provide an older Node.js through `apt`; the installer now checks the candidate version before installing and stops with a clear error if it is too old. In that case install a supported Node.js release separately, or opt into the nvm fallback: `./install.ps1 -RunUbuntuBootstrap -InstallOpenCode -UseNvmFallback`. This clones nvm v0.40.3 from its upstream GitHub repository and installs Node.js 22 under the current WSL user. The installer and launcher source `~/.nvm/nvm.sh` in noninteractive shells. Existing compatible Node.js installations are preserved.

To install only base Linux prerequisites:

```powershell
.\install.ps1 -RunUbuntuBootstrap
```

Or within Ubuntu:

```bash
bash scripts/bootstrap.sh --dry-run
bash scripts/bootstrap.sh
```

## Windows launcher verification

From the repository root, validate the launcher without starting WSL or an AI
executor:

```powershell
.\\start.ps1 -DryRun
.\\start.ps1 -DryRun -Distro Ubuntu-24.04 -Port 8787
```

Start the dashboard only after configuring WSL and base prerequisites:

```powershell
.\\start.ps1 -Distro Ubuntu-24.04
```

To enable an executor, review its workspace permissions and any provider charges
before passing `-AllowOpenCode` or `-AllowComfyUI`. The worker never starts
from the launcher dry run.

## Runtime integration (not automated yet)

1. OpenCode: install a supported Node.js release with npm, then run the opt-in
   installer in Ubuntu/WSL:

   ```bash
   bash scripts/install-opencode.sh --dry-run
   bash scripts/install-opencode.sh
   ```

   The script uses `npm install --global opencode-ai`, does not change
   existing OpenCode installations, and does not configure model providers.
   Review the upstream package before installing.
2. Ollama on Windows can be installed explicitly with `./install.ps1 -InstallOllama` (uses `winget install --id Ollama.Ollama --exact --source winget`). Use `-DryRun` to inspect first. The installer does not download a model, start the service, or verify connectivity. Select one Ollama host to avoid port conflicts.
3. Install ComfyUI in Windows with NVIDIA GPU support and test image generation independently.
4. Test model API connectivity before enabling any agent workflow.
5. Connect Codex CLI and Claude Code only through supported, documented endpoints and keep their existing credentials untouched.

Do not expose Ollama, ComfyUI or any model gateway to the public internet. Do not commit credentials, model tokens or private workspaces. Paid-model calls and Git pushes require explicit approval.

## Current scope

The Windows installer performs preflight, optional Linux prerequisites, and opt-in Node.js/OpenCode setup. Node.js from Ubuntu apt may be too old. Ollama has an opt-in Windows winget installer, but ComfyUI is not automatically installed. It does **not** install or run the full multi-agent platform yet.
